# rldm-project-1

The purpose of this project report is to replicate several results about temporal-difference learning described by Richard Sutton in his paper "Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences" (1988), in order to gain a deeper and better understanding of the TD method.

For the 3 experiments, I used python for coding and testing. In particular, I write the code and run in IPython of jupyter notebook. You will see a file named P1.ipynb that contains all the necessary code and running results for plotting figures.

In the first part, there is a function that used to initialize the training sets (100 or 1000). The second functions update_weight(weight, sequence, alpha, Lambda) is used to update the weight by using TD(lambda) method as described in the paper.

Following the first part, there are three different parts about the three experiments in the random walk example. The output is also shown fro each experiment. The figures of the plot in the report are from these data.

The running/testing of the code is very simple. Just open a python shell and copy/paste the code in the first part and run all the necessary functions. Then for the following three experiments, just comment the other two and run one by one. Once you get the output, simply use excel to plot the results.
